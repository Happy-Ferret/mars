// metadata descriptions

/* The idea is to describe your C structures in such a way that
 * transfers to disk or over a network become self-describing.
 *
 * In essence, this is a kind of version-independent marshalling.
 *
 * Advantage:
 * When you extend your original C struct (and of course update the
 * corresponding meta structure), old data on disk (or network peers
 * running an old version of your program) will remain valid.
 * Upon read, newly added fields missing in the old version will be simply
 * not filled in and therefore remain zeroed (if you don't forget to
 * initially clear your structures via memset() / initializers / etc).
 * Note that this works only if you never rename or remove existing
 * fields; you should only add new ones.
 * [TODO: add macros for description of ignored / renamed fields to
 *  overcome this limitation]
 * You may increase the size of integers, for example from 32bit to 64bit
 * or even higher; sign extension will be automatically carried out
 * when necessary.
 * Also, you may change the order of fields, because the metadata interpreter
 * will check each field individually; field offsets are automatically
 * maintained.
 *
 * Disadvantage: this adds some (small) overhead.
